# Property-discovery ledger

Per-cell verdicts, appended by the property-discovery loop (one block per resolved catalog cell).
This is the deliverable: the empirical map of which `(construct × source × technique)` cells hold,
and — the headline — where **smelt's own analyzer/maintenance is unsound or over-conservative**.

Verdict vocabulary (design §2.4): **HOLDS** = "no counterexample found over N schedules" (never
"proven"); **REFUTED** = a witness schedule diverges (a mapped admission-matrix boundary or a smelt
bug); **CONDITIONAL** = holds only under a named traded guarantee; **BLOCKED** = a design fork or
missing infra.

Block schema:

```
### CELL <id> — <construct> × <source_property> × <technique>
- verdict: HOLDS | REFUTED | CONDITIONAL | BLOCKED
- P (Link 0): <property>          skeleton_cols (Link B): <set>
- Link B facts: combiner=<…> reach=<(b,a)|Unbounded|NotDerivable> footprint=<bounded|unbounded>
- smelt analyzer: sound | over-conservative | unsound | not-derivable      [← ACTION if not sound]
- Link C: no divergence over <N> schedules | WITNESS: <breaking schedule + EXCEPT ALL rows>
- condition (CONDITIONAL only): <named guarantee traded, paper §6>
- experimental smelt extensions (if any): <sites tagged EXPERIMENTAL(property-discovery)>
- evidence: <test path::name>, <schedule count>, <oracle mode>
```
